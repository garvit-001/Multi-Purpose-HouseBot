<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Idea behind the project

The basic idea of this bot is to create a multi-purpose household bot with a lot of features which justifies its price for an average household. Most household bots today only do single things like cleaning, playing but without increasing hardware significantly (which will not increase the cost) we can add a lot of features. The bot will help in all day to day activities ranging from baby care, cleaning, security and a lot more. Many small and innovative ideas like detachable components and DIY tutorials will increase its usability and decrease cost. We will also make it modifiable and programmable by users so that they can experiment with it, learn, and add new features. 
The core idea is to  add innovative features with a limited hardware which solve small day to day problems.

This a boon for all the working parents out there who are looking for a reliable solution to their process of setting up a balance between parenting and work. We know how a parent wants the best for their child and is ready to spend any amount of money to establish an amazing future for them, but here, with our bot, we provide them with all the necessary help in the best quality while taking care of their pockets!


## About the project
We built our own vacuum cleaning household bot entirely from scratch using SolidWork and did various testing like airflow simulation,stress analysis guaranteeing its functionality in the real world. For navigation we used differential drive along with ROS Navigation stack and implemented 3 algorithms for Autonomus Mapping,Autonomus Navigation and Autonomus Optimal Complete Coverage.Also we implemented Resnet and YoloV3 Algorithms for Baby Monitoring.Threat Detection and Face Recognition.
### Built With

The technologies used while building and testing the project are:

* [ROS](https://www.ros.org/)
* [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/)
* [SolidWorks](https://www.solidworks.com/)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

How to set-up the project

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure your systme meets the following requirements:

* [ROS](https://www.ros.org/)
* [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/)
 
  

### Installation

Now that you're ready with the prerequisites, setup the project using the following steps-

```
cd catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/garvit-001/Multi-Purpose-HouseBot.git
catkin build ./
```

To launch bot in household environment run 
```
roslaunch rbot house.launch 
```

## Hardware
The CAD model of the bot was created using Solidworks. Further, an URDF file was created using the model considering the motion along all the links which were to be controlled and simulated using ROS. The bot’s vacuum system is based on a centrifugal pump. Centrifugal pump is a machine that imparts energy to fluid. This energy can cause a fluid to flow or rise to a higher level. It consists of two basic parts: The rotary element or impeller and the stationary element or casing.

We also conducted these tests to ensure the functioning of the bot-

a.Airflow (CFD-computational fluid dynamics): Simulated the  trajectories of air, dust particles inside the vacuum system of the bot and around the fan to ensure its proper working and for ensuring proper dust collection, calculating suction force


b.Stress analysis (FEA-finite element analysis): To ensure that the main body or wheels do not deform/break due to the weight of other components present inside or when it (by mistake) collides with any object/wall / human interaction.

## Navigation

We used Differential Drive along with ROS Navigation Stack on our Bot to autonomously navigate it through house.We developed 4 moods for it's navigation-

 a.*Teleop Controlled*-In this you can simply control bots motion by publishing on cmd_vel topic.

 b.*Autonomous Mapping*-This will be used when a new bot comes to home,in this bot will autonomously map the whole house by finding regions which are not mapped.We used <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/explore_lite">explore_lite</a> along with ROS Navigation Stack for this.To launch this mood run
 ```bash
 roslaunch rbot mapping.launch
 ```
 
 c.*Autonomous Navigation*-This will allow you to autonomously send bot anywhere in generated also avoiding both static and dynamic obstacles.We used ROS Navigation Stack along with <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/teb_local_planner">teb_local_planner</a> as local planner.To launch this mood run 
  ```bash
 roslaunch rbot navigation.launch
 ```
 d.*Autonomous Complete Coverage*-In night you can simply run this mood and bot will autonomously vacuum your whole house following an optimal complete coverage path.We have used <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/full_coverage_path_planner">full_coverage_path_planner</a> as global planner along with teb_local_planner as local planner.To launch this mood run-
 ```bash
 roslaunch rbot complete_coverage.launch
 ```

## Features

#### AI/ML Dependencies and Packages Required:

* OpenCV
* CV_bridge
* Matplotlib
* Numpy
* Tensorflow-Keras(required for face recognition)
 

### Face Recognition

- We use a custom build AI model, combining both, a pretrained ResNet model and the OpenCV haarcascade funtion to develop face recognition algorithm.

- The weights of the model were pretrained, they convert the image into a vector of length 128. And then the vectors are compared between themselves using a siamese network architecture. 

- The OpenCV haarcascade function first detects all the images in a given frame and then compares the faces with those present in the database. (Already stored in the system)

- If the faces match or are within a threshold value, the bot recognises the person and greets them. If not, the bot considers it as an intruder and triggers an alarm through the system.
- You can see the code [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1R8DMmd4irxbfXU8tUebgAP64VtLyI3eQ?usp=sharing)

Find the demo of Face Detection algorithm implementation [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K6rV0f0d-TTYmIyUp-HNQ1cQ1N9isJMF/view)

### Baby Threat Detection

- The same algorithms used above are applied here.
- The objective being to protect a baby from an outsider or intruder when the parents are not at home.
- The algorithm first recognises all the faces in the frame and if both baby and intruder are detected in a frame, it triggers an alarm.

### Baby Following

- As we know, Babies crawl around all the time.
- And may swallow things or be around dangerous objects like knife, scissors, etc. 
- This feature of the bot follows the baby around and triggers an alarm or sends parents a message when the baby is near a harmful object or so.
- Here we use custum build algorithm using pretrained YOLOv3 weights to perform object detection.
- The YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) model is an object detection architecture that uses a 106 layer network comprising of multiple Convolution, residual and 1\*1 kernel layers to perform the object detection task.
